## 🔐 Security Disclaimer

Vitreon Notes is a local-first application. Your encryption keys (derived from your `VITE_ENCRYPTION_SALT` and `VITE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) are essential to decrypt your data. **If you lose these variables or change them, previously encrypted notes will be unrecoverable.** Always keep a secure backup of your environment configuration.
